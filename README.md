For this assignment, you will become familiar with the VLSI tools you will use throughout this
semester, learn how a design “flows” through the toolflow, and practice Chisel coding. Specifically,
you will write an RTL model of a greatest common divisor (GCD) circuit, synthesize and place and
route the design, simulate at every stage, and analyze power
